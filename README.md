# Web App: UvAcourses

*Proposal for a Web App project for the course Web App studio*

With the UvA courses app, users are able to 'shop' for courses at the University of Amsterdam

###*Features:*

## Classes and methods

1. Models 
	* Users database so users are able to login and retrieve the courses they are enrolled for (showing in the home page feed)
	* Enrolled courses database linked to the users' database with a user ID
	* Shoppingcart database listing the courses the user is currently shopping for

2. Views
	* Sign up page, a user needs to sign up with their student ID number, a password and their email
	* Sign in page
	* Home page listing a 'feed' to show what courses a logged-in user has enrolled for (with a delete option to drop the course)
	* Search page wherein users are able to retrieve the available courses and put them in a shopping basket
	* 'Shopping basket' wherein picked courses are stored until 'checkout'
	   
3. Controllers
	* User controller to handle logins, sign out, sign up, any changes in enrolled courses etc.
	* Static pages controller to handle static pages like home, about the app and contact
	* Sessions controller to handle user login and keep track of it using cookies	
	* Enrolled courses controller to handle the courses feed at the users' homepage and any changes to it (dropping course with delete/destroy, enrolling courses)
	* 'Relationshipsâ€™ controller to handle has_many and belongs_to relationships
	* Something to handle the temporary storage of the users' shopping basket
             
###*Frameworks, languages, libraries or other technologies:*
* Ruby on Rails for the basic implementation
* HTML and CSS for layout and styling (might use a library like Bootstrap or any other libraries I come up with after further research)
* SQLite for any database actions
* AJAX to create a button that puts courses in the shopping basket / a temporary database to shop for courses without refreshing the page
